    <h1>Question 1: Using 3 different internet networks (university wireless, university wired- common lab machines, home, coffee shop ,4G data plan for cellphone, etc.): </h1>
        <h2>a. Measure the speed of each network using http://speedtest.net/, and take a snapshot for each one, include them in the answer level and caption them.</h2>
        <h2>b. What is the minimum internet speed (connection speed) you may consider as a web designer and why?</h2>
            <h3>The miminum internet speed that I consider as a web designer would be a little slower than the average user. If I optimize my site enough to run smooth on slow connections, it will have no problem running on a higher-speed connection.</h3>

            <h3>This website does not have native accesssibility features for the most part due to it being a website based on user submissions. However, twitter does have a method for users to add descriptions for visually impaired individuals. Twitter also supports third party screen-reader software, such as apple's VoiceOver function for Mac and iOS. Twitter uses an F style viewing patter, since readers scroll down and read from left to right for each post. On non-mobile devices, twitter uses active AND passive whitespace. The active whitespace is seen on each side of the website to emulate a mobile aesthetic. The passive whitespace can be seen everywhere else, such as the space between letters, pictures, and posts. </h3>
