<p>The website I chose is dustloop.com. It is a wiki website used by fighting game players to learn about the different moves of characters from many games. The site will display information about a character and give a description of their playstyle, followed by a list of all their moves. When I removed the css stylesheet from the website, I noticed various things. First of all, the sidebar of the website dissapeared, and I could not find it until I scrolled to the very bottom of the page, where it was located, unformatted. Also, the font family,size, formatting was removed as well. The shaded borders of the move information/description was missing, and the border around the character's picture on the right was gone as well. On the normal website, the active whitespace looks very intentional and is easy on the eyes. In the version of the website without css, there is active whitespace but it does not seem intentional, and there is almost too much white space. Essentially when css is applied correctly, it transforms a normal website into a professional, clean website. Below are my screenshots of the website. The first two pictures are of the site with CSS, and the next 3 are the website when the css stylesheet is removed.</p>
