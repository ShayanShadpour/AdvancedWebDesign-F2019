<h3>Healthy Stir Fry and Curry</h3>
<p>
Again, kids love stir fry and most love curry. What makes these curry healthy is canned full fat coconut milk and no store-bought sauces. And I always use super easy homemade stir fry sauce in my stir fries. Again, no bottled stuff with preservatives or complicated ingredients.
<br>
Stir fries are loaded with veggies, therefore are so healthy. So serve on its own for low carb meal (for a mom) and with complex carb side for everyone else. Healthy dinner made easy! </p>

<h3>Healthy Chicken Dinners</h3>
<p>
We eat a lot of chicken. Probably just like you. When buying chicken I usually buy organic because of what it was fed and the way it was raised. Costco is my go-to source for chicken.
<br>
I usually serve these simple chicken dishes with a side of quinoa, brown rice, buckwheat or mashed potatoes. And a simple salad like cucumber and tomato salad and lots of lettuce salad. When we are “lazy”, my husband makes a green smoothie. </p>

<h3>Healthy One Pot and Sheet Pan Dinners</h3>
<p>
These one pot and sheet pan dinners prove that 30 minute healthy dinner can be flavorful without washing 3 pots. With one pan cooking it’s important to figure out the right combination of foods, so pasta doesn’t get mushy or meat remains not fully cooked. Below, are all tried and true one pot wonders and I’m working on more. </p>
